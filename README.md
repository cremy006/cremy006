The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting with 0 and 1. The sequence begins: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, and so on. This mathematical pattern appears frequently in nature, such as in the arrangement of sunflower seeds, the petals of flowers, and the spiral patterns of pinecones and shells. 
How it works
Starting numbers: The sequence begins with 0 and 1. 
The rule: To find the next number in the sequence, you add the two previous numbers together. 
0 + 1 = 1
1 + 1 = 2
1 + 2 = 3
2 + 3 = 5
And so on...
Examples in nature
Flowers: The number of petals on many flowers is often a Fibonacci number. 
Sunflowers: The seeds in a sunflower head are arranged in spirals, and the number of spirals in each direction is frequently a Fibonacci number. 
Pinecones: The scales on a pinecone also form spirals that often correspond to Fibonacci numbers. 
Shells: The spiral growth of some snail shells can be approximated by a Fibonacci spiral. 
Why it's important
The Fibonacci sequence is significant because it represents an efficient growth pattern. In plants, this pattern can maximize light exposure for leaves or optimize the packing of seeds. It's a fundamental concept in mathematics and a recurring pattern in the natural world.
